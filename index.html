			PROJECT SUMMARY
			This project aims to prove that even in our attempts as designers to create cool simplicity, being accessible 1st can go a long way; Both in design, functionality, and gravitating users. That accessibility 1st can go hand in hand with captivating design. Because quite frankly,  brutalism as a concept is inherently inclusive of access.

				BACKGROUND
					Brutalism. The use of Centers, minimal, lines, and flats- has dominated UI/UX web design spaces since 2021. And quite frankly, it is still trending strong in 2022.<br>

				“Brutalism in digital design is a style that intentionally attempts to look raw, haphazard, or [plain]. It echoes early 1990s-style websites,” (Kate Moran, 2017). Many of what we see in recent Brutalist UI designs appear as naked HTML site with blue links, harsh lines, plain colors, 2D - very flat and monochromatic Monospace font.<br>

				In architecture, “Brutialism is rooted in the ideas of functionalism and monumental simplicity that had defined earlier architectural modernism… Brutalism is a utilitarian aesthetic movement that shuns decoration in favor of exposing and celebrating the raw materials used to construct the design,” (Le Corbusier & Marcel Breuer).<br>

				These architectural concepts have definitely transpired through modern UI design. 
				Though now, it continues to embrace flat design, strong outlines, contrasting colors, bold typography and real/life photography. Alongside that, it embraces grids that guides user eye movements. And while these bold simplicity aims to captivate user attention, oftentimes- designers and clients alike neglect the essence and imperative nature of accessibility when it comes to brutalism.
