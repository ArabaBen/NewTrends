			This project aims to prove that even in our attempts as designers to create cool simplicity, being accessible 1st can go a long way; Both in design, functionality, and gravitating users. That accessibility 1st can go hand in hand with captivating designs. Because quite frankly,  brutalism as a concept is inherently inclusive of access. Both in information and functionality. And for those who need a hand grasping accessibility should take on brutalism as a challenge.

<!--	BACKGROUND & CHALLENGES-->
		
		<div class="container">
			<div class="row row-cols-2">
				<div class="col">
					<h4>Background</h4>
					<p><br>Brutalism. The use of centers, minimal, lines, and flats- has dominated UI/UX web design spaces since 2021. And quite frankly, it is still trending strong in 2022.<br></p>
					<p>“Brutalism in digital design is a style that intentionally attempts to look raw, haphazard, or [plain]. It echoes early 1990s-style websites,” (Kate Moran, 2017). Many of what we see in recent Brutalist UI designs appear as naked HTML site with blue links, harsh lines, plain colors, 2D - very flat and monochromatic Monospace font.<br></p>
					<p>In architecture, “Brutialism is rooted in the ideas of functionalism and monumental simplicity that had defined earlier architectural modernism… Brutalism is a utilitarian aesthetic movement that shuns decoration in favor of exposing and celebrating the raw materials used to construct the design,” (Le Corbusier & Marcel Breuer).<br></p>
				</div>
				<div class="col">
					<h4> Challenges</h4>
					<p><br>These architectural concepts have definitely transpired through modern UI design. Though now, it continues to embrace flat design, strong outlines, contrasting colors, bold typography and real/life photography.
						
						<br><br>Alongside that, it embraces grids that guides user eye movements. And while these bold simplicity aims to captivate user attention, oftentimes- designers and clients alike neglect the essence and imperative nature of accessibility when it comes to brutalism. </p>
					
					<p><br> The challenge is accessiblity. How can beginer coders, web designers, and clients approach app designs being accessblity 1st and aesthically pleasing simontanouly.</p>

<!-- CHALLENGES/ ACCESSIBLITY -->
		<div class="essay">
			
			<h4>THE CHALLENGE: ACCESSIBILITY</h4>
				
				<br><p>
			<strong>Colors:</strong> this too can be aesthetically pleasing and accessible friendly. There is beauty in contrasting colors. 
			<br><strong>Grids:</strong> they guide the glide of the user's eyes through the page. chose their direction and placement well. 
			<br><strong>Lines:</strong> Bold or thin, separating content enhances readability. 
			<br><strong>Fonts:</strong>Bigger can be better, but not always. When it comes to having more white space available, bigger fonts throughout a page’s layout isn’t always best. Stick with the golden rule- bigger for titles, and headers. Bolds & Italics for emphasis. Plane size for details and paragraphs. But just the same, you can go with monosized fonts throughout entire page - if that’s your aesthetic
			<br><strong>Icons & images:</strong> Some web design takes brutalism rarely consisting of icons or many images. Studies have shown that when it comes to accessibility, icons & images are worldly understood by users and are more inclusive than words can only be. Add them.

<!--	METHODS AND RESULTS SECTION-->

				<div class="col">
					<h4>Methods</h4>
					<p>To complete this project we began researching  and analyzing sample sites for background and context. To understand Brutalsim and its relevance in the push for web accessibility. In phase 2 we focused on color theory and aesthetic features of contrasting colors.  Phase 3 we began building our exemplary project wireframe using Figma, Coolors, open source images, notion, maze and <a href="">w3c contrast checker</a>. Then finally deploying the project.</p>
				  
				</div>
				<div class="col">
					<h4>Results</h4>
					<p>We found that in the case of Brutalism, you can do no wrong with accessibility. From composing a web app with monochromatic analogous color to high contrasting pop colors; monosized fonts to the push for more icons and images- everyone's aesthetic needs can be met.</p>
